A client-side application built purely with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**. It provides a clean, mobile-first user interface for scanning barcodes and consuming data from the external [Health Scan ZA API](https://YOUR-RENDER-APP-NAME.onrender.com/api). The UI is inspired by the Yuka mobile application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Local Run

This is a static site and can be opened directly in a browser.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/health-scanner-frontend-repo.git
    cd health-scanner-frontend-repo
    ```
2.  Open `index.html` in your browser.

**Note:** For the **Camera Scan** feature to work, the page must be served over a local web server (e.g., VS Code's Live Server extension) or `http://localhost`, as browsers block camera access from direct `file://` paths.
